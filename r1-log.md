**Today's Progess:** Today I the layout for the home section and added a widening animation to the navigation bar. I added my profile picture and my intro and so far it looks very similar to Alex's website. 

**Thoughts:** Today I feel like made some progress coimpared to yesterday but that's mostly because I know how to the home section. I still like I am struggling.

**Today's Progess:** I did the logo area for the navbar and the skills section where I added icons. I also styled the section headers.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm not making much progress at the moment and I have a headache and I almost gave up the challenge because of it, but thankfully didn't.

### R1D5 July 26, 2021

**Today's Progess:** Today I did 22/28 concepts of Basic HTML and HTML5 on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today I changed my approach to going back to learning the fundamentals because I have a weak foundation on web design. According to Elon Musk learning the foundations will be crucial to learning deeper topics. Because knowledge is like a tree every strong big tree with many branches have a strong root holding the tree down. So I had a weak foundation that's why I am having a hard time coding so that's why went back and freeCodeCamp's platform is project-based so it's perfect.

### R1D6 July 27, 2021

**Today's Progess:** Today I completed Basic HTML and HTML5 28/28 and Basic CSS 17/44. I learnt about values for radio buttons and checkboxes and the declarations for HTML the DOCTYPE, head and body and also div. I also got into styling with font-sizes, colors, font-family, padding, border and margin. I also did background-color, border-radius and width. 

**Thoughts:** HTML is pretty simple but CSS seems very complex there's like a whole dictionary full of CSS properties. Going back to the fundamentals was a great step becasue now I know why I'm doing and coding somethings and I'm understanding the standards for coding.

### R1D7 July 28, 2021

**Today's Progess:** Today I learned about CSS specifically:<br>
                        Padding & margin- specific sides, clockwise notation<br>
                        Attribute selectors<br>
CSS variables<br>
Colors- hex code & RGB<br>
Inheritance & overriding<br>
Media query<br>
Relative vs absolute units<br>

**Thoughts:** It's better to start early in the day and not to be greedy. Overall today was pretty chill. Especially how I didn't have to record a video. Oh and I'm removing that because it doesn't make sense for tweets. I was originally for training for public speaking and reviewing.

**Today's Progess:** Today I did Applied Visual Design 34/52. Learned about the color theory, font-size and weight and tags that add text-decoration to your text. Spacing and sizing of text and z-index. Also did positioning. 

**Thoughts:** Today was chill, I started early and got little bit greedy and did a bit more.
