### R1D2 July 23, 2021

**Today's Progess:** Today I the layout for the home section and added a widening animation to the navigation bar. I added my profile picture and my intro and so far it looks very similar to Alex's website. 

**Thoughts:** Today I feel like made some progress coimpared to yesterday but that's mostly because I know how to the home section. I still like I am struggling.

### R1D4 July 25, 2021

**Today's Progess:** I did the logo area for the navbar and the skills section where I added icons. I also styled the section headers.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm not making much progress at the moment and I have a headache and I almost gave up the challenge because of it, but thankfully didn't.

### R1D5 July 26, 2021

**Today's Progess:** Today I did 22/28 concepts of Basic HTML and HTML5 on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today I changed my approach to going back to learning the fundamentals because I have a weak foundation on web design. According to Elon Musk learning the foundations will be crucial to learning deeper topics. Because knowledge is like a tree every strong big tree with many branches have a strong root holding the tree down. So I had a weak foundation that's why I am having a hard time coding so that's why went back and freeCodeCamp's platform is project-based so it's perfect.
